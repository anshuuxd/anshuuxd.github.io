      <h2>My Warm Sorry 🤍</h2>

      <p>
        Dear <strong>Bhavu</strong>,<br><br>
        If I could hug away every tear and mistake, I would spend my whole life doing just that.
        I know I’m not perfect, but my love for you is stubborn, soft, and forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m sorry for whatever hurt you, for every careless word, for every moment that
        made your heart feel a little heavier. You deserve laughter, comfort and peace –
        and I want to be the reason you feel all three.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for staying, for trying, for loving me in your own beautiful way.
        You’re not just a part of my life — you are my favourite chapter,
        my safest place, my home.
      </p>

      <p class="highlight">
        So this little website is my way of saying:
        I’m sorry, I love you, and I’m not going anywhere. 💖
      </p>
