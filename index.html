      You mean so much to me. More than my ego, more than any fight, more than
      any stupid mistake I make. I’m learning, I’m growing, and I’m trying every
      day to be the person you deserve.

      This little website is just my way of saying: <br />
      <strong>please don’t stay mad at me… I love you so much. 💖</strong>
